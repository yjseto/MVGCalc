can evaluate with letters like x if it is defined as some number
eval can take global and local parameters
security issues
 ^ operator is XOR not power
can evaluate linear equations by transforming them into a complex equation

i definetly think its possible to write our own code for arithmatic
but if we want to do calculus its better to use a library


using :
b = 'False or False'
while True:
    try:
        b = b + b[5:]
        print(len(b), eval(b))
    except:
        print (len(b))
        break
        
eval max is 75 megabytes
